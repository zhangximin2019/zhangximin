# Towards Robust DNNs An Taylor Expansion-Based Method for Generating Adversarial Examples
Corresponding code to the paper "Towards Robust DNNs An Taylor Expansion-Based Method for Generating Adversarial Examples" 2020.

Implementations of the three attack algorithms in Tensorflow. It runs correctly
on Python 3.6  and matlab 2018b.

model.image_size: size of the image (e.g., 28 for MNIST, 32 for CIFAR)
model.num_channels: 1 for greyscale, 3 for color images
model.num_labels: total number of valid labels (e.g., 10 for MNIST/CIFAR)
